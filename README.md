RollingBall
===========

This game is my first game using Unity. You control a ball that can roll and jump around. I put together a few blocks for the ball to jump on. The level can easily be changed by adding more blocks, by changing the lengths of the blocks, and/or by moving the blocks around in the 3D space.

Unity Objects
=============

- One Sphere (Ball)
- One Directional Light (Sun)
- One Camera
- Any number of Cubes (Ground)

Unity Components
================

Add the BallControl.js and BallFall.js to the sphere object.
Add the CameraControl.js to the Camera.
Add any textures and any skybox you'd like.
